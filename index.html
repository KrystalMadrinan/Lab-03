    <main>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jerica. I recently moved from Houston, TX. I escaped the heat and flooding. I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I've work for several different IT companies as a systems analyst and I have designed a few websites on the side. I have even worked odd jobs from time to time. </p>
    <p>My goal is to become a great software developer and build applications that range from helping people to do their
      work and learn to even building games. I plan to get as much as I can out of attending Code Fellows.</p>
