      <h2>Name: Jerica Mitchell</h2></br>
      <p>
        I have a bachelor's degree in
        Information Technology. I've work for several different IT companies as a systems analyst and I have designed a few
        websites on the side. I have even worked odd jobs from time to time. </p> </br>
